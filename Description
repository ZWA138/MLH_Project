Project Update: In-Hospital Mortality Prediction for Stroke Patients Using MIMIC-IV Data
My Implementation until now:
Data Extraction:
Extracted key clinical features from MIMIC-IV, including lab results (e.g., Urea Nitrogen/Creatinine ratio) and vital signs (e.g., Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate).
Merged this data with in-hospital mortality (hospital_expire_flag) from the admissions table.
Initial Modeling:
Trained a Logistic Regression model with features including BUN/Creatinine ratio and vital signs.
Achieved an accuracy of ~82% and an ROC AUC of ~0.66 after handling missing values via imputation and NaN removal.
Advanced Models:
Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to improve predictive performance.
These models are currently running, and weâ€™ll share their evaluation results (accuracy and ROC AUC) soon.
Model Performance:
Random Forest:
Accuracy: 91.46%
ROC AUC: 0.879
XGBoost:
Accuracy: 90.88%
ROC AUC: 0.910
